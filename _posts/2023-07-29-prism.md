Federated learning of large models face huge challenges at the edge. Edge users usually do not own sufficient 
computation power, making it difficult to train large models. In this project, we develop a new methodology that
can train large models at the resource-constrained edge via a sub-model training method.

## Overview

At a high level, we aim to decompose a large model into small sub-models and let each edge user train a sub-model. Then
the server aggregate all sub-models to reconstruct a full model.

However, different from other sub-model training methods, we create sub-models to ensure that 

- all sub-models are approximations to the full model

- all sub-model covers different part of the full model

### Sub-Model Creation

We first use SVD to convert kernels in a NN layer to principal kernels, with singular values indicate the importance of
each principal kernel. Then we adopt a novel sampling process to sampling kernels based on singular values, so that
> Principal kernels with large singular values have higher probability to be sampled.

In this way, we can ensure 1) all sub-models approximate to the full model; 2) different sub-models are created with 
different kernels.


### Reasoning

Each principal captures distinct features in the input. Therefore, by distributing the principal to different clients, 
we allow different clients to learn different feature extractors. Then, the server aggregates these feature extractor 
to obtain the final learned model.
