Torch FX is a toolkit to transform `torch.nn.Module` instances to a high-level intermediate representation (IR).
It can generate a list of node of operators and the execution flow. 

Compared to LLVM IR, FX is a more high-level IR that generates graph representation consisting standard torch.nn modules.
