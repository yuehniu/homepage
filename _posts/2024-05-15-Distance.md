How to measure **distance** is a very fundamental problem in many domains. In this post, I give an overview of commonly used distance metrics.
Importantly, I will dig into some metrics if they are related. I will also try to describe how each metric is used in actual problems.

## Spatial Distance

Spatial distance is the most intuitive concept that measure how far two *points* are. 
Such a simple concept can be generalized to many different scenarios. 

### Euclidean Distance

Euclidean distance is the most basic concept that we have learned. 
It answers the smallest distance from point $A$ to point $B$.

Given point $A: (x_1, y_1, z_1, \cdots)$, and point $B: (x_2, y_2, z_2, \cdots)$ in a high-dimensional space, we have

\[ d_{Enc} = \sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 + (z_1-z_2)^2 + \cdots } \]

Such a simple concept has been adapted in many different forms. 
For instance, its variant, also commonly known as mean-square error (MSE),
has been widely used in measure how good solution $A$ is, compared to baseline $B$. 
By using the Euclidean distance as an error metric, it is also applied to many optimization problems such as
linear regression, [low-rank approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-rank_approximation).
