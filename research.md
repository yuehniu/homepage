### Asymmetric Learning for Privacy-Preserving ML

<img src="_research/asymml/overview.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Exploring low-rank structure of **data** in machine learning is very important. 
Along this line of research, we leverage low-rank structure of data and propose asymmetric learning framework that
achieves privacy-preserving model learning and inference.
