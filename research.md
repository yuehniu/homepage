Exploring low-rank structure of **data** in machine learning is very important. 
Along this line of research, we leverage low-rank structure of data and propose asymmetric learning framework that
achieves privacy-preserving model learning and inference.

Federated learning of large neural nets at the edge faces significant challenges due to
the limited computation and memory on-device resources. 
**Sub-model** training methodology presents a promising solution.
We investigate a new sub-model training method that reduces computations at the edge while still attaining a full model.
